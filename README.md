======
Time spent: 10-12 hours (mostly to figure out TTTAttributedLabel) 
Tasks complete: 
Add a container view and modify properties: backgroundColor, cornerRadius, font, textColor, shadowOffset.
Add buttons with different images for default and highlighted.
Add UIImageViews and choose the right mode: aspect fill, aspect fit, etc.
Add a UITextField with a background image.
Add UILabels with attributed text (instead of plain text), so that you can bold individual words.
Setup CocoaPods for managing 3rd party libraries and use TTTAttributedLabel to style the link and make it clickable
Optional: Move the textfield when the keyboard appears.
